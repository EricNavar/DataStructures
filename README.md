# Data Structures and Algorithms

### Linear Data Structures
 - Queue
 - Stack
 - Dynamic Array
 - LinkedList
### Sorting Algorithms
 - SortingA.h: provides functions that sort arrays
 - SortingV.h provides functions that sort vectors
 - SortingVP.h provides functions that sort vectors holding pointers. The objects being pointed to are what is supposed to be sorted
### Graphs
 - GraphLL: Graph implemented with an adjacency list
 - Kruskal's algorithm
 - Dijkstra's algorithm
### Demos
 Other algorithms/concepts
